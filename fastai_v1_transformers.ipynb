    "In [question answering (QA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering) systems are built that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. These computer systems excel at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. In contrast, humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the [Google QUEST Q&A Labeling competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview), we're tasked with predicting different subjective aspects of question-answering. The data for this competition includes questions and answers, and the task is to predict target values of 30 labels for each question-answer pair.Target labels with the prefix question_ relate to the question_title and/or question_body features in the data, and target labels with the prefix answer_ relate to the answer feature.\n",

    "This is not a binary prediction challenge. Target labels are aggregated from multiple raters, and can have continuous values in the range [0,1]. Submissions are evaluated with the mean [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)."

    "The first **transfer learning** method applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) was [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1801.06146.pdf).(ULMFiT) method. This method involves starting with a pre-trained language model (LM), for example, trained on the Wikitext 103 dataset, and then fine tuning the language model on a new dataset. The fine tuned language model can then be used ina classification task for the new dataset. A demonstration is in the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4), incorporating other techniques like discriminate learning rates, gradual model unfreezing, and slanted triangular learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, a new architecture called the **Transformer** (cf. [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) has been shown to be powerful. Google (BERT, Transformer-XL, XLNet), Facebook (RoBERTa, XLM) or even OpenAI (GPT, GPT-2) have pre-trained their own models (that use architectures based on the Transformer) on very large corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "These transformers are availiable through the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) 🤗 [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Formerly knew as ``pytorch-transformers`` or ``pytorch-pretrained-bert``, this library has both pre-trained NLP models and additional utilities like tokenizers, optimizers and schedulers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel uses the ``transformers`` library within the ``fastai`` framework. Specifically, I am using the [RoBERTa model](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-roberta-distilbert-xlnet-which-one-to-use-3d5ab82ba5f8). I've broken the process down into different parts:\n",
